##  How To Use

-  Run the program. (This is a windows application.)
-  Enter the CFM.
-  Select the duct liner choice. Duct sizes are the outside sheet metal sizes. The air stream area is reduced by the duct liner.
-  Select the surface roughness. The manual Ductulator does not account for surface roughness.
-  Select or enter the design PLPH factor (pressure loss inches per hundred feet duct). Selecting the duct pressure class will set the typical PLPH values.
-  Enter and indicate any velocity limit the design needs.
-  Select the duct shape type rectangular or flat oval.
-  Read the circular solution at the bottom and the rectangular or flat oval solutions in the table at the right.
